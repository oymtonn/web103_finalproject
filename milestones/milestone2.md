## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to complete all of the planning for the entire project, and complete the wireframes and entity diagram.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The entity diagram was a little challenging due to the many different tables required for our project and having to choose what kind of relationship a table should have with another was confusing.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We have all the support we need for now, though that may change next week.
