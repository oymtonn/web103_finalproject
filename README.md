## About

### Description and Purpose

A site geared towards students who want to keep their schedules more orgnanized, and need a little bit of motivation to keep up with it. This site will give students the ability to create 'habits' that they will need to complete for the timeframe they set (e.g. daily or weekly). They will also have a place for larger projects/assignments and check them off when complete. All of this will be shown on a dashboard where students are able to track their progress daily.

### Inspiration

As students being on track with school assigments, personal projects, extracirricular activities, and good habits is really difficult. It requires a lot of motivation and determination to keep track of everything, so a tool that can help guide that process would be extremely beneficial.
